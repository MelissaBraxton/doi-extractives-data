    The state government of Montana administers 5.2 million surface acres of land (about 5.6% of the state) and 6.2 million mineral acres. For detailed information about land ownership in each county, the Montana State Library maintains [public and private land ownership maps](https://mslservices.mt.gov/Geographic_Information/Maps/Land_Ownership/Default).
state_revenue: |
    Revenue from natural resource extraction on federal, state, and private land is a significant source of revenue for state and local governments in Montana. In FY 2014, the state of Montana and county tax collectors collected $446 million from natural resource revenues. The Oil & Natural Gas Production tax accounts for roughly half of Montana’s revenue from natural resource extraction.

    **Revenue sustainability:** In 2014, natural resource revenue streams accounted for 17.4% of revenue collected by the Montana Department of Revenue. Over the last four years, Montana’s overall revenue has increased while revenue from natural resources has stayed relatively flat; the percentage of revenue from natural resources has decreased from 13.5% of total revenue that went to the state general fund in 2010 to 11.3% in 2014.

### State agencies

The state of Montana regulates extraction and interacts with extractive industry companies in Montana, particularly when they're operating on state or private land.

The [Montana Department of Revenue](https://revenue.mt.gov/) collects, manages, and distributes  revenue from companies engaged in extraction of oil, natural gas, coal, and non-energy minerals in Montana. It publishes [biennial reports](https://revenue.mt.gov/home/publications/biennial_reports) and other [tax related reports](https://revenue.mt.gov/home/publications). County governments also collect many property taxes.

The [Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation](http://dnrc.mt.gov/) manages Montana's natural resources, including administering state trust lands and distributing revenue from state trust lands.

- The [Montana Board of Oil and Gas Conservation](http://bogc.dnrc.mt.gov/BoardSummaries.asp) is involved in all stages of oil and gas extraction. It permits all oil and gas wells, regulates the underground injecting program, and assists in remediation efforts. It also inspects all oil and gas wells and operations to ensure they comply with all state environmental laws. The board is governed by [rules and regulations](http://bogc.dnrc.mt.gov/rulesregs.asp).
- The [Reclamation and Development Grant Program](http://dnrc.mt.gov/divisions/cardd/resource-development/reclamation-and-development-grants-program) funds some abandoned mine projects.
- The [Mineral Management Bureau](http://dnrc.mt.gov/index/divisions/trust/minerals-management) (within the [Trust Land Management Division](http://dnrc.mt.gov/divisions/trust)) permits, regulates, and collects revenue for extraction on state trust lands. Their work complements the work of the Board of Oil and Gas Conservation and Department of Environmental Quality, both of which retain regulatory authority over mines on state lands. State land leasing is governed by state [statutes and rules](http://www.mtrules.org/gateway/chapterhome.asp?chapter=36.25).

The [Montana Department of Environmental Quality](http://deq.mt.gov/) leads Montana's planning, permitting, compliance, enforcement, and remediation efforts for projects and incidents related to air, water, land, and energy.

- The [Air, Energy, and Mining Division](http://deq.mt.gov/DEQAdmin/AEM) is charged with protecting the quality of Montana's air, water, and land. Its responsibilities and roles include:
  - Issuing air quality permits for oil and gas wells
  - Issuing permits and monitoring compliance for projects relating to coal and hardrock mines
  - Determining correct control measures and establishing requirements to ensure compliance with laws and regulations
  - Providing technical assistance in bringing violations back into compliance
  - Preparing enforcement requests for the [Enforcement Division](http://deq.mt.gov/DEQAdmin/ENF)
  - Holding and reviewing reclamation bonds for [coal](http://deq.mt.gov/Land/CoalUranium) and [hardrock mining](http://deq.mt.gov/Land/hardrock)

- The [Waste Management and Remediation Division](http://deq.mt.gov/DEQAdmin/WMR) administers and oversees investigation and cleanup of extraction sites that need remediation.
- County tax collectors collect and distribute the county portion of ad valorem taxes (except the coal gross proceeds tax).

### State laws and regulations

The [Constitution of the State of Montana](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca_toc/Constitution.htm) includes environmental protections, including a right to a “clean and healthful environment,” and provisions for environmental protection, improvement, and reclamation.

The Montana Code Annotated (MCA) has several sections that govern natural resource extraction:

+ [Title 82: Minerals, Oil, and Gas](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca_toc/82.htm) includes statutes related to minerals, oil, and gas.
+ [Title 15: Taxation](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca_toc/15.htm) covers taxation. See chapters 35 (Coal Severance), 36 (Oil & Gas Production Tax), 37 (Mining License Taxes), and 38 (RIGWAT Tax).
+ [Title 77: State Lands](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca_toc/77.htm) covers state lands. See Chapter 3 (Rock, Mineral, Coal, Oil, and Gas Resources).
- The _Montana Environmental Policy Act (MCA §75-1-101, et seq.)_ aims to ensure environmental impacts are considered in state planning (including environmental impact statements).
- The _Clean Air Act of Montana (MCA § 75-2-101, et seq.)_ seeks to “achieve and maintain levels of air quality that will protect human health and safety and, to the greatest degree possible, prevent injury to plant and animal life.”
- The _Water Quality Act (MCA §75-5-101, et seq.)_ aims to "conserve water by protecting, maintaining, and improving the quality of water" throughout the state and to "provide a comprehensive program for the prevention, abatement, and control of water pollution."
- The _Montana Metal Mine Reclamation Act (MCA §82-4-301, et seq.)_ provides for reclamation of hard rock and metal mines.

The Administrative Rules of Montana also regulate natural resource extraction:

- [Title 36: Natural Resources and Conservation](http://www.mtrules.org/Gateway/Department.asp?DeptNo=36) covers the Department of Natural Resources & Conservation. See chapters 19 (Reclamation and Development Grants Program), 22 (Board of Oil & Gas Conservation), and 25 (State Land Leasing).
- [Title 17 Environmental Quality](http://www.mtrules.org/Gateway/Department.asp?DeptNo=17) covers the Department of Environmental Quality. See chapters 8 (Air Quality), 24 (Reclamation), and 30 (Water Quality).

### Fiscal costs of extractive activity

In addition to generating revenue, extractive industries can bring costs to state and local communities. In Montana, these costs are concentrated in eastern Montana because of extraction from the Bakken Formation in Montana and neighboring North Dakota. For more extractive industries' effect on this region, see the Eastern Montana Impact Coalition's [Regional Impact Analysis (PDF)](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/529fb9b4e4b0edf62d295374/t/55e9eb5be4b098674aefb5fe/1441393499939/Abbreviated+EMIC+Regional+Impact+Analysis+2015.pdf).

The USEITI {{ term | "Multi-Stakeholder Group" }} prioritized four types of fiscal costs in the 2015 USEITI report:

* **Transportation:** The Montana Department of Transportation estimates an additional $52 million per year in increased pavement needs for highways in eastern Montana because of extractive industry activity. Local governments in eastern Montana also saw increases in budgets for streets and roads increase 44% to 345% from 2000 to 2013.  
  
  To read more, see the [Montana Department of Transportation report (PDF)](http://www.mdt.mt.gov/other/webdata/external/research/docs/research_proj/oil_boom/summary_mdt_efforts.pdf) on efforts to respond to impacts on the state highway system from oil exploration and production in eastern Montana.

* **Water:** Surveyed communities in eastern Montana reported that water rates increased an average of 86.4% from 2011 to 2014 and sewage rates increased 302.9%. The Eastern Montana Impact Coalition also estimates that $33.8 million to $80.6 million will be needed for incremental improvements to support growing demand on water, sewage, and transportation systems. These figures don’t include large projects.

  The Department of Environmental Quality plans, monitors, assesses, and enforces [water quality](http://deq.mt.gov/Water) in Montana. It performs targeted water quality monitoring related to oil and gas development in eastern Montana and coal mining near Lake Koocanusa, runs the [Montana Ground Water Pollution Control System](http://deq.mt.gov/Water/WQINFO/mgwpcs) and its permitting process, and produces [Clean Water Act Integrated Reports](http://deq.mt.gov/Water/WQPB/cwaic/reports).

* **Emergency services:** Increased population near extraction can increase demands on emergency services. Law enforcement at multiple jurisdictional levels in eastern Montana have seen costs rise related to increases in oil and gas activity.

  The State Highway Patrol added a new detachment in eastern Montana, county sheriffs' offices have seen costs rise $13.4 million, and surveyed police departments have seen an average budget increase of 128.9% between 2000 and 2013. Surveyed local governments also reported an average increase of 169.2% in emergency spending from 2000 to 2013.

* **Reclamation:** Multiple organizations in the Montana state government work on the reclamation and remediation of sites related to extraction. The Department of Environmental Quality Waste Management and Remediation Division administers state and federal superfund sites, as well as Montana’s [abandoned mine land projects](http://deq.mt.gov/Land/AbandonedMines). Montana has been “certified” by the federal Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation program, meaning that it has reclaimed its identified, high-priority abandoned coal mine areas. [Current projects](http://deq.mt.gov/Land/AbandonedMines/CurrentProjects) include addressing acid mine drainage in the Great Falls coal field, which is projected to cost $96 million, and managing subsidence events and potential subsidence in Red Lodge.

  To learn more, find Annual Evaluation Reports for Montana in the [Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement Oversight Document Database](http://odocs.osmre.gov/) or learn about the bonding of active mines in the [Coal Program Annual Report](http://deq.mt.gov/Land/CoalUranium/annualreports).

  The Conservation and Resource Development Division of the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation runs the [Reclamation and Development Grants Program](http://dnrc.mt.gov/divisions/cardd/resource-development/reclamation-and-development-grants-program) to fund projects that “compensate Montana citizens for the effects of exploration and mining on Montana lands.”

  The [Montana Department of Justice Natural Resources Damage Program](https://dojmt.gov/lands/) administers grants for the restoration of the Upper Clark Fork River Basin’s natural resources “due to mining and mineral processing operations.” Between 2000 and 2011, the governor approved 121 projects totaling $121 million.

### Tax expenditures

Tax expenditure programs are policy instruments that reduce state and local revenue through changes to the tax code (for example, tax credits, exemptions, preferential tax rates, or deferrals of tax liability).

In FY 2014, Montana had four programs related to the extractive industries, which reduced state or local revenue by a total of $60.5 million. Of that total, a tax holiday on new oil production cost Montana $55.9 million in unrealized tax revenue and tax holiday on new natural gas production holiday cost the state $2 million. The Montana Department of Revenue outlines tax expenditures in its [biennial reports](https://revenue.mt.gov/home/publications/biennial_reports).
