        <h1>Reconciliation</h1>

        <p>Every country that participates in EITI reconciles its data.</p>

        <p>The 2015 USEITI report looked at calendar year data for 2013. The 45 companies invited to participate are listed here, along with reported payments and reconciliation results for each revenue type. To learn more, review the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/reconciliation/#scope">scope</a> of the reconciliation process or the list of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/reconciliation/#in-scope-companies">companies</a> included.</p>

                    <li>Differences in accounting systems. Some companies record transactions in their accounting systems differently than the government does, so revenue categories (such as rents, taxes, and royalties) may get lumped differently.</li>
